# Wasmpedia
An Open Source encyclopedia for WebAssembly (Wasm).

This project is *very* early WIP.

## What is Wasm?
WebAssembly, or "wasm", is a general-purpose virtual [ISA] designed to be a compilation target for a wide variety of programming languages. Wasm was originally designed for the web, but is being used in many places outside of it. The features it needed to succeed in the web make it portable, secure, and fast which is something we need in all kinds of applications. 

## What content goes here?

In the future, we may add content about the ecosystem and specific runtimes / tools, but for now we will stick to wasm concepts and proposals.
